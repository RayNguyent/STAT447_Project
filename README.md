# STAT447_Project
This project implements Bayesian spatial models to analyze the spatial distribution of snowfall and its underlying patterns. Utilizing spatial priors, such as Gaussian Processes, the study investigates the relationships between snowfall and geographical parameters like latitude, longitude, and elevation.

## Features:
- Visualization of spatial relationships using color-coded maps with GeoJSON files.

- Spatial interpolation to predict snowfall in regions with limited or missing data.

- Analysis using Gaussian Process.
  
## Usage:
- Data processing: Incorporates weather station datasets to extract relevant features.

- Spatial modelling: Implements a Bayesian Gaussian process model where the GP part for spatial random effect and its covariance construction remain the same..

- Visualization: Generates geographically-referenced maps.
