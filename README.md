# STAT447_Project
This project implements Bayesian spatial models to analyze the spatial distribution of snowfall and its underlying patterns. Utilizing spatial priors, such as Gaussian Processes, the study investigates the relationships between snowfall and geographical parameters like latitude, longitude, and elevation.

## Features:
- Visualization of spatial relationships using color-coded maps with GeoJSON files.

- Spatial interpolation to predict snowfall in regions with limited or missing data.

- Analysis using hierarchical modeling and geographic data.

## Usage:
- Data processing: Incorporates weather station datasets to extract relevant features.

- Spatial modeling: Implements Bayesian hierarchical models with Gaussian processes.

- Visualization: Generates interactive, geographically-referenced maps.
